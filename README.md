My name Is King Williams, Yes, That's right, King, Im named after my father who also happens to be named after his father. I've been in love with technology and gaming since I was a child, and I'm hoping to find a career in it in the future. As a game Design Major here at ODU, my skills range from 3D modeling to storyline development, and character design.
